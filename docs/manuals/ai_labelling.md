# A Simple Guide to the Carry Bag Quality Control System

## Welcome!

Welcome to the Quality Control team! This guide will walk you through how to use our new system to inspect carry bags. Your job is to be the expert detective who finds, marks, and reports any issues with our products. This system is designed to make that job clear and easy.

Let's get started!

---

### Understanding Your Workspace

When you begin, you'll see a screen split into two main parts:

1.  **üìã Reference Standard (The "Perfect" Bag):** On the left, you'll see a picture of what the bag is *supposed* to look like. This is your guide for perfection.
2.  **üîç Product Under Inspection (The "Real" Bag):** On the right is the picture of the actual bag you need to inspect. This is your workspace where you will mark any problems you find.

You can use the zoom tools on either image to get a closer look!

## Your Step-by-Step Inspection Process

Follow these steps in order for every bag you inspect.

### Step 1: Fill in the Product Information

At the very top, you'll see the **üì¶ Product Information** box. You must fill this out first.

*   **Product Type:** Click the menu and choose the type of bag (e.g., "Shopping Bag").
*   **Carry Bag Size:** Click the button for the correct size (e.g., "9x13").
*   **Material Type:** Click the button for the bag's material (e.g., "Paper").
*   **Batch Information:** Click in the text box and type the Batch ID, production date, and any other details you have.

### Step 2: Mark All Defects on the "Real" Bag

This is the most important part of your job. In the **üéØ Advanced Defect Marking Tools** section, you'll find different tools for different types of problems.

**To mark a defect: First, click the name of the defect, then draw on the "Real" Bag image.**

Here are the tools and what they're for:

#### Tool 1: The Outlining Tool (Polygon Labels)

Use this to draw a precise outline around defects that have weird shapes.

*   **What it's for:**
    *   `‚úÇÔ∏è Irregular Tear`: For rips that aren't a straight line.
    *   `üîç Complex Stain`: For large, oddly shaped stains.
    *   `üîÑ Shape Deformation`: To show where a bag is bent or crushed out of shape.
    *   `üìè Edge Damage`: To trace along a damaged or messy edge.
*   **How to use it:**
    1.  Click the label (e.g., `Irregular Tear`).
    2.  On the image, click once to start your outline.
    3.  Keep clicking to place points around the edge of the defect.
    4.  To finish, **double-click** your last point.



#### Tool 2: The Pinpoint Tool (KeyPoint Labels)

Use this to place a single dot on a very small, specific problem.

*   **What it's for:**
    *   `üï≥Ô∏è Hole/Puncture`: To mark the exact spot of a hole.
    *   `‚ö´ Spot Defect`: For tiny specks of dirt or ink.
    *   `üî∏ Foreign Particle`: To show a piece of loose material that shouldn't be there.
    *   `ü´ß Air Bubble`: To mark a bubble trapped under the bag's surface.
*   **How to use it:**
    1.  Click the label (e.g., `Hole`).
    2.  On the image, click once on the exact center of the defect.



#### Tool 3: The Highlighter Tool (Brush Labels)

Use this to "paint" over a larger area where the problem is spread out and has no clear edge.

*   **What it's for:**
    *   `üü§ Contaminated Area`: For widespread dirt, dust, or smudges.
    *   `üü° Discolored Zone`: For a large patch where the color is faded or wrong.
    *   `üîµ Texture Problem`: For an area where the bag's material feels wrong.
    *   `üî¥ Print Bleeding`: To show where ink has bled out from a printed design.
*   **How to use it:**
    1.  Click the label (e.g., `Contaminated Area`).
    2.  On the image, click and hold your mouse button, then drag it to "paint" over the entire problem area.



#### Tool 4: The Measurement Tool (Line Labels)

Use these to draw lines to check alignment and size. These are very important for making sure everything is in the right place.

*   **What it's for:**
    *   `üìè Alignment Reference`: **Draw this on the "Perfect" Bag.** For example, draw a line along the top of the logo on the perfect bag. This creates a reference line to help you see if the logo on the real bag is crooked.
    *   `üìê Measurement Line`: Use this on the "Real" Bag to measure anything, like the width of a handle or the length of a tear.
    *   `üìè Edge Line`: Use this to trace the sides of the "Real" Bag to make sure it was cut straight.
    *   `üìã Fold Line`: Use this to trace the creases on the "Real" Bag to see if it was folded correctly.
*   **How to use it:**
    1.  Click the label (e.g., `Measurement Line`).
    2.  On the image, click at the start of your line, drag your mouse to the end, and release.

### Step 3: Summarize Your Findings

After you've marked everything on the image, you need to answer some questions. Scroll down to the next sections.

1.  **‚úÖ Phase 1: Tick Verification:** Look for the small tick marks on the packaging.
    *   Answer the questions about the **Product Name Tick** and **Product Size Tick**. Is the tick there? Is it clear?
    *   Use the star rating to say how good the tick mark looks.

2.  **üîç Phase 2: Comprehensive Defect Detection:** This is a checklist to summarize your work.
    *   For every defect you marked on the image, find the matching description in these lists and click it. For example, if you marked an `Irregular Tear`, you should also click the `üìÑ Torn Packaging` button.
    *   You can select multiple options.

---

### Step 4: Make the Final Decision

Now it's time to make the final call on the bag's quality.

*   **üìä Overall Quality Assessment:**
    *   **The Big Decision:** This is the most important button. Choose one:
        *   `PASS`: The bag is perfect or has very minor issues. It can be sold.
        *   `FAIL`: The bag has a major problem. It must be rejected.
        *   `REWORK`: The bag has a problem that can be fixed.
        *   `HOLD`: You are unsure. Set it aside for a manager to review.
    *   **Quality Confidence Level:** Use the stars to show how sure you are about your decision.
    *   **Severity Score & Sliders:** Use the sliders to give a score for how bad the defects are and the overall quality of the printing, packaging, etc.

---

### Step 5: Add Notes and Finish Up

You're almost done! The last step is to provide written details.

1.  **ü§ñ AI Recommendations:** The system will suggest what to do. You can agree with it or choose a different option based on your expert opinion.

2.  **üìù Inspector Notes & Documentation:** This is your chance to explain anything that the buttons couldn't.
    *   **Inspector Notes:** **Be specific!** Explain *why* you failed a bag. For example, "The tear on the front panel is over 3 inches long and goes through the logo."
    *   **Root Cause Analysis:** If you have a guess as to *what* caused the problem, write it here. (e.g., "The cutting machine seems to be misaligned.")
    *   **Inspector Info:** Type your name/ID and the date.

Once everything is filled out, click the **Submit** button. Congratulations, you've completed your inspection




### Part 1: "If I have selected `torn_area`, why can't I select `alignment_ref`?"

This is a key feature of how the system works. Think of it like using tools in real life.

When you click on **`torn_area`**, you have picked up the "Irregular Tear" drawing tool. The system is now in **drawing mode**. It is waiting for you to draw the tear's outline on the "Real Bag" image.

You cannot pick up a new tool (like **`alignment_ref`**) while you are still holding the "Torn Area" tool.

**To switch to a new tool, you must first put the current tool down.** You have two options:

1.  **FINISH your drawing:** Draw the complete outline for the `torn_area`. Once you finish (by double-clicking), the tool is automatically "put down," and you are free to select a new label like `alignment_ref`.

2.  **CANCEL your action:** If you clicked `torn_area` by mistake and don't want to draw anything, simply press the **`Escape` (Esc) key** on your keyboard. This cancels the action, "puts the tool down," and allows you to select any other label.

**In Short:** The system can only have one tool "active" at a time. Finish or cancel your current drawing before you can select a new one.

---

### Part 2: "Do I have to use `alignment_ref`, `measurement`, `edge_line`, and `fold_line` on all images?"

**No, absolutely not.** You only use these tools when you need to investigate or prove a specific kind of problem.

Think of these four labels as your special **measuring and comparison tools**. You only take them out of your toolbox when you see something that looks wrong and needs to be measured or compared.

Here is a detailed guide on **WHEN** to use each one:

#### 1. `alignment_ref` (Alignment Reference)

*   **Purpose:** To create a "correct" line on the **"Perfect" Bag (Reference Standard)** image so you can easily spot alignment errors on the real bag.
*   **When to use it:** You see a bag where the logo, text, or handle seems crooked, tilted, or in the wrong place.
    *   **Example Workflow:**
        1.  You are inspecting a bag where the main logo looks a little low.
        2.  Select `alignment_ref`.
        3.  Go to the **"Perfect" Bag** image on the left. Draw a line perfectly along the bottom of the logo on that image.
        4.  Now, look at the "Real Bag" on the right. The reference line you drew will also appear there, making it instantly obvious if the logo on the real bag is lower than it should be.
*   **When to skip it:** If the alignment on the bag looks perfectly fine, there is no need to use this tool.

#### 2. `measurement` (Measurement Line)

*   **Purpose:** To measure the exact size of a defect or a feature on the bag.
*   **When to use it:**
    *   A defect needs to be measured (e.g., "Is this tear longer than the 2-inch maximum we allow?").
    *   A feature on the bag looks like it might be the wrong size (e.g., "This handle looks shorter than the handles on other bags.").
*   **When to skip it:** If there are no defects that need measuring and all parts of the bag look to be the correct size, you do not need to use this tool.

#### 3. `edge_line` (Edge Line)

*   **Purpose:** To carefully check the quality of the bag's outer edges.
*   **When to use it:**
    *   You notice an edge looks wavy or crooked instead of straight.
    *   An edge is frayed, damaged, or poorly cut.
    *   You suspect the bag's overall dimensions are wrong. By tracing the edges, you can easily compare its shape to the reference image.
*   **When to skip it:** If the bag is cut cleanly and the edges are straight and undamaged, you do not need to trace them.

#### 4. `fold_line` (Fold Line)

*   **Purpose:** To check if the bag has been folded correctly.
*   **When to use it:**
    *   You see a crease where there shouldn't be one.
    *   A required fold is missing.
    *   A fold is in the wrong place, is crooked, or looks messy.
*   **When to skip it:** If all the folds and creases look correct and are in the right places, you do not need to use this tool.

### Summary

*   **Use your eyes first.** Inspect the bag visually.
*   **Select the right tool for the problem.**
*   The four line-drawing tools are for **investigating specific issues** with size, position, and shape.
*   **If the bag looks perfect in these areas, you do not need to use these four tools.** Your job is to find and report defects, not to mark up a perfect bag.
